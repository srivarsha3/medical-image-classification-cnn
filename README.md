# Medical Image Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to classify
chest X-ray images into **Normal** and **Pneumonia** categories.  
The model helps in understanding how deep learning can assist medical diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a deep learning model that automatically classifies medical images
and supports faster and accurate disease detection.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual analysis of medical images is time-consuming and prone to human error.
This project aims to automate the classification process using machine learning.
